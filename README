The region service client obtains cloud specific SMT information from the
region service and then uses this information to "register" the guest image
with the SMT server.

The server hosts for the region service are configured in the
/etc/regionserverclnt.cfg file.

After obtaining the information from the region server the code uses the
standard clientSetup4SMT.sh script to setup the repositories.
